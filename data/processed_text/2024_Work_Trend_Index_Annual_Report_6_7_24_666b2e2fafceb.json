The study is the first\nmass-scale observation of 3,000 individuals using AI in their natural work environment with no interventions from the researchers\nto encourage use. Preliminary results show how AI could reshape the anatomy of the workday in fundamental ways—reducing time\nspent in inboxes, making meetings more valuable, and increasing time spent on high-value focus work.\nEmails: Overall, Copilot users read 11% fewer individual emails and spent 4% less time interacting with them.\nThe customers who saw the most impact spent 25%–45% less time reading emails.\nMeetings: In some companies time spent in meetings increased, in others it decreased. One hypothesis is that AI\nmakes meetings more valuable—as stores of information and a shortcut to creation, like a brainstorming meeting,\neasily turned into a first draft. For some companies, the increased efficiency leads to fewer meetings, and at others\nthe increased value leads to more. As AI capabilities progress, researchers expect this effect to continue—allowing\nus to reduce time in some meetings while making the meetings we do have more valuable.\nDocuments: Overall, Copilot users edited 10% more documents in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—the companies\nthat saw the largest impact noticed a 20% increase. This may suggest that people are repurposing the time they\nsave for high-value focus work like creating and consuming information.\n25\n2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report\nfrom Microsoft and LinkedIn\nKey Takeaways\nThe opportunity ahead for leaders is to channel employee enthusiasm for AI into business transformation.\nThis will look different for every organization, but here’s how to get started.\nIdentify a business problem, then apply AI: There are efficiency gains to be had across every function—\nthe key is to pick a process and apply AI. For example, start with customer service and focus on improving call-\nhandling time. Global advertising network dentsu applied AI to its creative development process. Estée Lauder is\nusing it to reimagine product development and customer experience.\nTake a top-down, bottom-up approach: Going from experimentation to transformation requires engagement at\nevery level of the organization, from the CEO to the entry-level employee. Business gains will come when you enlist\nyour business line leaders to activate teams around AI. As we’ve rolled out Copilot at Microsoft, we’ve relied on\ninternal champions at all levels to model and spread AI enthusiasm and aptitude.\nPrioritize training: AI power users aren’t doing it on their own—they receive ongoing training, both on universal\ntasks and uses more tailored to their role and function. LinkedIn Learning is a great place to\nstart to skill up, and the Copilot Scenario Library\u0007provides\u0007use\u0007cases\u0007for\u0007specific\u0007roles\u0007and\u0007functions.\u0007\n26\n2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report\nfrom Microsoft and LinkedIn\nThe Path For ward\nWe’ve arrived at a pivotal moment for AI at work. Just as we look back at the pre-PC era,\nwe’ll one day wonder how work got done without AI. Already, AI is helping people be more\ncreative and productive, and giving job seekers an edge. Over time, it will change every\naspect of work. As we reach the hard part of this tech disruption—turning experimentation\ninto tangible business impact—companies that face the challenge head-on will surge ahead.\nIn this moment, fortune favors the bold.\nSee how the data compares for small and medium-sized businesses and in US metropolitan areas.
