Recommend further investigation before determining liability.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n1. Interview additional witnesses\n2. Complete detailed review of security footage\n3. Request complete medical records from claimant\n4. Evaluate business safety procedures and staff training records\n5. Schedule follow-up discussion with insured by May 16, 2024\n\nCLAIM STATUS: UNDER INVESTIGATION",
