CLAIMS ADJUSTER NOTES
Preliminary investigation shows potential shared liability. While the business did place warning signs, their placement and visibility may have been inadequate. Restaurant's cleaning procedures appear to have been followed, but staff training on proper warning sign placement might need review. Recommend further investigation before determining liability.

NEXT STEPS
1. Interview additional witnesses
2. Complete detailed review of security footage
3. Request complete medical records from claimant
4. Evaluate business safety procedures and staff training records
5. Schedule follow-up discussion with insured by May 16, 2024
